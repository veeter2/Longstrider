# Cursor Changes Review - Session 2025-10-31

## Status: In Progress

---

## ‚úÖ Reviewed & Decided

### KEEP
1. **memory-surface-card.tsx** (NEW)
   - Status: Rebuilt after accidental deletion
   - Next: Move to left rail (not chat center)

2. **cce-response/index.ts**
   - Enhanced memory surfacing with full metadata
   - Sends 10 memories instead of 5
   - Keeps metadata for Living Memory details view

3. **longstrider-store.ts**
   - Added `insertMessageAt()` for message positioning
   - Added optional `memoryId` parameter
   - Status: Keep for now, may adjust when testing

4. **chat-center.tsx** (PARTIAL)
   - ‚úÖ KEEP: Enhanced metadata badges (tokens saved, calculator method, compression, etc.)
   - ‚ùå TODO: REMOVE memory surface card rendering from chat

5. **cognition_intake/index.ts**
   - Realtime broadcast for memory_created events
   - Non-blocking, good for left rail updates
   - Status: Keep for now

### REVERT
1. **living-memory/system.tsx**
   - Status: ‚úÖ REVERTED
   - Reason: Called thread-manager directly, bypassed CCE-O
   - Next: Redesign to query through CCE-O

### KEEP (No Changes Needed)
1. **thread-manager/** (NEW edge function)
   - Purpose: Aggregation layer over gravity_map
   - Called BY CCE-O, not by frontend
   - See: [CCE-O-ARCHITECTURE.md](CCE-O-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## üîÑ Still To Review

1. **chat-center.tsx** - Remove memory card rendering
2. **chat-left-rail.tsx** - Unknown changes
3. **space-creation-interview.tsx** - Component changes
4. **space-creation-interview.ts** - Enhanced hierarchy parsing (340+ lines)
5. **spaces/create/page.tsx** - Space creation page
6. **types/longstrider.ts** - Type definitions

### New Files Not Yet Reviewed
- `lib/sync-space-to-thread.ts`
- `components/living-memory/memory-timeline.tsx`
- `supabase/migrations/*.sql`
- Various docs in `docs/surgical-plan/`

## üéØ Key Architectural Decisions

### The Vision
**"Waterfall/Project Management" style interface:**
- **Chat Center** = Fast conversation (minimal clutter, quick metadata badges)
- **Left Rail** = Real-time metrics (memory count, token savings, goal progress, patterns)
- **Living Memory** = Deep dive (full thread intelligence, project view, memory arcs)

### CCE-O Architecture (CRITICAL)
**One door in, one door out:**
```
Frontend ‚Üí CCE-O only
           ‚Üì
    [Internal orchestration]
    - conductor
    - recall
    - response
    - thread-manager ‚Üê Called BY CCE-O
           ‚Üì
    gravity_map (source of truth)
           ‚Üì
Frontend ‚Üê CCE-O (SSE stream)
```

**Never bypass CCE-O:**
- ‚ùå Frontend ‚Üí thread-manager (WRONG)
- ‚ùå Frontend ‚Üí gravity_map (WRONG)
- ‚ùå Living Memory ‚Üí thread-manager (WRONG)
- ‚úÖ Frontend ‚Üí CCE-O ‚Üí [internal calls] ‚Üí Frontend (CORRECT)

See: [docs/CCE-O-ARCHITECTURE.md](CCE-O-ARCHITECTURE.md)

## üìù TODOs for Next Session

1. Remove memory card rendering from chat-center.tsx
2. Review chat-left-rail.tsx changes
3. Review space-creation-interview changes (complex hierarchy parsing)
4. Decide on sync-space-to-thread.ts (delete or keep?)
5. Review migrations (add to thread-manager integration?)
6. Test the changes that we're keeping
7. Implement memory surfacing in left rail

## üö® Lessons Learned

1. **Don't delete files hastily** - memory-surface-card.tsx incident
2. **Review one file at a time** - prevent overwhelm
3. **Understand the vision first** - CCE-O architecture clarification was key
4. **Document for future agents** - Created CCE-O-ARCHITECTURE.md

---

**Next Session:** Continue reviewing remaining files, then test integration
