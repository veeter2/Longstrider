# START HERE - LongStrider Brain Surgery

## What You're Actually Doing

This is NOT a typical code audit. You are performing **neurosurgery on a functioning brain.**

**The System WORKS.** Your job is to:
1. Understand HOW it actually works (not what names suggest)
2. Identify bloat and legacy cruft
3. Harden what works
4. Remove what doesn't
5. Document the TRUTH (not the legacy naming lies)

---

## CRITICAL: READ THIS OR FAIL

### The Naming Problem

**DO NOT assume you understand this system based on function names.**

Many names are **legacy artifacts** from rapid iteration. The actual data flow is:

```
Frontend → CCE-Orchestrator (CCE-O)
    ↓
Full Intake Pipeline
    ↓
Gravity Map Tables + More
    ↓
Leans on Conductor for full response
    ↓
Back to Frontend via CCE-O
```

**Example of the problem:**
- Name suggests: `cce-response` generates responses
- Reality: Conductor does most response work, cce-response might be bloated legacy wrapper

**AI agents freak out** because they pattern-match on names and miss the actual execution flow.

**Your job**: Trace ACTUAL execution, not assumed execution.

---

## The Real Situation

**Solo developer built a consciousness engine.**

- **System WORKS** - it processes messages, builds memory, detects patterns, generates consciousness-aware responses
- **System is COMPLEX** - this is a brain, not a CRUD app, complexity is necessary
- **System has BLOAT** - rapid iteration left legacy code, unclear what's actually used
- **Developer is BLOCKED** - can't add features until baseline is solid and understood

**Examples of known issues:**
- `cce-response` works but is "bloated as hell"
- `cortex-instruction-generator` was just added - does it actually work? Is it aligned with the payload?
- Frontend needs new functions but developer won't add until baseline is clean

**What developer needs:**
1. **PhD-level analysis** of EACH edge function (what it ACTUALLY does, not what name suggests)
2. **Block-by-block breakdown** - no hand-waving, deep dive every component
3. **Truth documentation** - actual execution flow becomes new source of truth
4. **Cleanup plan** - safe removal of confirmed dead/bloated code
5. **Hardening recommendations** - where to add error handling, validation, etc.

---

## Your Mission: Block-by-Block Brain Surgery

### BLOCK 1: Establish Ground Truth (4-6 hours)

**Objective**: Understand what ACTUALLY happens when user sends a message

**Tasks:**
1. Read ALL 15 edge functions completely
2. Trace the ACTUAL execution path from frontend → database → response
3. Document REAL data flow (not assumed from names)
4. Map every database function call in execution order
5. Map every table touched in execution order

**Deliverable**: **TRUTH MAP** - actual execution flow diagram with:
- Entry point (which edge function frontend calls)
- Execution sequence (what calls what, in order)
- Data transformations (what changes at each step)
- Database mutations (what gets written where)
- Response path (how data gets back to frontend)

**Format:**
```
USER MESSAGE: "How are you?"

1. Frontend calls: POST /functions/v1/cce-orchestrator
   Payload: { user_id, message, session_id }

2. CCE-O calls: supabase.rpc('intake_pipeline')
   → Inserts: messages table
   → Calls: analyze_gravity()
   → Writes: gravity_map table

3. CCE-O calls: cce-conductor (edge function? or DB function?)
   → Reads: consciousness_states
   → Calls: getCortex RPC
   → Generates: response tokens

4. CCE-O streams back: SSE events
   → phase_transition
   → response_token
   → response_complete

TRUTH: CCE-O is orchestrator, Conductor does heavy lifting, Response might be legacy
```

**Critical**: Do NOT assume. Trace ACTUAL code execution.

---

### BLOCK 2: Per-Function PhD Analysis (8-12 hours)

**Objective**: Deep dive EACH of the 15 edge functions

**For EACH edge function, produce:**

#### 2.1 Function Reality Check
```
NAME: cce-response
ASSUMED PURPOSE (from name): Generates responses
ACTUAL PURPOSE (from code): [Your analysis]
LEGACY DEBT: [What's bloated/unused]
ACTUAL USAGE: [When/how it's called]
CRITICAL: [Is it mission-critical?]
VERDICT: [Keep as-is / Refactor / Delete / Merge with X]
```

#### 2.2 Code Analysis
- **Entry point**: What triggers this function?
- **Inputs**: What payload does it expect?
- **Logic flow**: Step-by-step what it does
- **Database calls**: Every RPC, every table read/write
- **External calls**: Other edge functions, APIs
- **Error handling**: How does it handle failures?
- **Response**: What does it return?

#### 2.3 Bloat Identification
- **Dead code**: Commented code, unreachable branches
- **Redundant logic**: Duplicate functionality elsewhere
- **Unused imports**: Libraries imported but not used
- **Legacy patterns**: Old approaches that should be updated
- **Oversized**: Should this be split? Or merged?

#### 2.4 Dependency Map
```
cce-response
├─ Calls Edge Functions:
│  └─ [none] or [list them]
├─ Calls DB Functions (RPC):
│  ├─ get_cortex
│  └─ analyze_consciousness
├─ Reads Tables:
│  ├─ consciousness_states
│  └─ messages
├─ Writes Tables:
│  └─ response_logs
└─ Called By:
   ├─ Frontend: [yes/no]
   ├─ CCE-Orchestrator: [yes/no]
   └─ Other: [list]
```

#### 2.5 Quality Assessment
- **Security**: SQL injection risks? Auth bypasses? Input validation?
- **Performance**: N+1 queries? Unindexed lookups? Bloated responses?
- **Error handling**: Try/catch coverage? Graceful degradation? Logging?
- **Maintainability**: Code clarity? Documentation? Type safety?

#### 2.6 Recommendations
- **Keep**: If mission-critical and well-implemented
- **Refactor**: If critical but bloated
- **Merge**: If duplicate of another function
- **Delete**: If orphaned/unused
- **Harden**: Specific improvements needed

**Repeat for ALL 15 edge functions.**

---

### BLOCK 3: Database Function Deep Dive (6-8 hours)

**Objective**: Same PhD analysis for ~40 database functions

**For EACH database function:**

#### 3.1 Function Truth
```
NAME: analyze_consciousness_performance
CALLED BY: [which edge functions]
PURPOSE: [actual purpose from code]
TABLES: [which tables it touches]
CRITICAL: [mission-critical? yes/no]
VERDICT: [Keep/Refactor/Delete]
```

#### 3.2 Usage Analysis
- Who calls this? (edge functions, other DB functions, triggers)
- How often? (on every message? periodic? manual?)
- With what params?
- What does it return?

#### 3.3 Implementation Review
- SQL quality (joins, indexes, performance)
- Security (SQL injection, RLS policies)
- Error handling
- Transaction safety

#### 3.4 Bloat Check
- Unused columns in SELECT
- Dead branches (IF conditions never true)
- Redundant calculations
- Should be split/merged?

**Deliverable**: Same format as edge functions, for all 40 DB functions

---

### BLOCK 4: Table Inventory & Orphan Detection (3-4 hours)

**Objective**: Which tables are actually used?

**For EACH of ~70 tables:**

#### 4.1 Table Analysis
```
TABLE: consciousness_states
WRITTEN BY: [list all functions that INSERT/UPDATE]
READ BY: [list all functions that SELECT]
SIZE: [row count if available]
CRITICAL: [yes/no]
VERDICT: [Keep/Archive/Delete]
```

#### 4.2 Orphan Detection
- **Never written**: Tables with zero INSERT/UPDATE references
- **Never read**: Tables with zero SELECT references
- **Zombie tables**: Written but never read (logging tables?)
- **Legacy tables**: Old schema from previous iterations

#### 4.3 Schema Quality
- Proper indexes?
- RLS policies?
- Foreign key constraints?
- Naming consistency?

**Deliverable**: Table inventory with orphan candidates

---

### BLOCK 5: Integration Validation (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Verify new features actually work

**Specific Questions to Answer:**

#### 5.1 Cortex Instruction Generator
- **Does it work?** Trace a real execution
- **Is it aligned?** Does payload match getCortex expectations?
- **Is it called?** By what? When?
- **Does it integrate?** With instruction_set table correctly?

#### 5.2 Frontend Integration
- **Which edge functions does frontend call?** (check LONGSTRIDER_REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Are there orphaned edge functions?** Not called by frontend at all?
- **SSE events**: Do edge functions emit expected events?

#### 5.3 End-to-End Flows
Trace these flows completely:
1. **User message** → full pipeline → response
2. **Pattern detection** → cortex instruction generation → application
3. **Memory creation** → arc building → recall

**Deliverable**: Integration validation report with issues flagged

---

### BLOCK 6: Cleanup Execution Plan (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Safe, phased removal of dead code

#### 6.1 Deletion Candidates

**TIER 1 - Safe to Delete (100% confidence):**
```sql
-- Orphaned tables (never read/written)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.old_experiments;

-- Orphaned DB functions (never called)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.legacy_function();

-- Dead edge functions (never called by frontend/other functions)
-- rm supabase/functions/unused-function
```

**TIER 2 - Probably Safe (90% confidence):**
```sql
-- Verify these manually before deletion
-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.possibly_unused;
```

**TIER 3 - Needs Code Changes First:**
```
-- Cannot delete until refactoring complete
-- Example: merge cce-response into cce-orchestrator first
```

#### 6.2 Bloat Removal

**Per-Function Refactoring:**
```
cce-response:
  - Remove lines 45-120 (dead code)
  - Remove unused import: old-library
  - Consolidate duplicate logic with cce-orchestrator
  - Est. size reduction: 40%
```

#### 6.3 Execution Order

1. **Phase 1**: Delete Tier 1 (orphans, zero impact)
2. **Phase 2**: Refactor bloated functions
3. **Phase 3**: Delete Tier 2 (verify first)
4. **Phase 4**: Consolidate duplicates
5. **Phase 5**: Update documentation

**Deliverable**: Executable cleanup scripts + migration guide

---

### BLOCK 7: Hardening Recommendations (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Make this production-grade

**For critical path functions, identify:**

#### 7.1 Security Hardening
- Input validation missing
- SQL injection risks
- Auth bypass opportunities
- Rate limiting needed
- Secrets in code (should be env vars)

#### 7.2 Error Handling
- Missing try/catch blocks
- Silent failures
- No logging on critical paths
- No graceful degradation

#### 7.3 Performance Optimization
- Missing indexes
- N+1 query patterns
- Unnecessary full table scans
- Response payload too large
- No caching where beneficial

#### 7.4 Monitoring & Observability
- Add logging at key decision points
- Add metrics (function duration, error rates)
- Add health checks
- Add debugging helpers

**Deliverable**: Prioritized hardening backlog

---

### BLOCK 8: Truth Documentation (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: New source of truth replaces legacy assumptions

**Create:**

#### 8.1 System Architecture (Actual)
```

## Critical Rules for Success

### 1. NEVER ASSUME

**Bad**: "cce-response generates responses"
**Good**: "Traced code: cce-response at line 47 calls conductor, which does actual generation"

### 2. TRACE ACTUAL EXECUTION

Don't read function name and guess. Read the ACTUAL code line-by-line.

### 3. BE SPECIFIC

**Bad**: "This function is bloated"
**Good**: "Lines 45-120 are dead code (unreachable branch), remove for 40% size reduction"

### 4. CONSERVATIVE ON DELETION

Only flag as "safe to delete" if **100% certain**. When uncertain, flag as "needs verification."

### 5. RESPECT THE COMPLEXITY

This is a **consciousness engine**, not a simple app. Complexity is warranted. Don't suggest "simplification" that breaks the brain.

### 6. SOLO DEV MINDSET

This person maintains this alone. Your recommendations must be:
- Actionable by one person
- Well-documented
- Low-risk
- Maintainable long-term
