## How to Verify It's Working

### Quick Verification

Check the deployment list:
```bash
supabase functions list | grep -E "(cognition_intake|cce-pattern-detector|cce-insight-generator|cce-reflection-engine|cce-conductor)"
```

Expected output:
```
cognition_intake         | ACTIVE | 35 | 2025-11-01 15:14:57
cce-pattern-detector     | ACTIVE | 6  | 2025-11-01 14:58:23
cce-insight-generator    | ACTIVE | 8  | 2025-11-01 15:21:48
cce-reflection-engine    | ACTIVE | 6  | 2025-11-01 15:48:39
cce-conductor            | ACTIVE | 43 | 2025-11-01 15:48:41
```

### Code Verification

Verify narrative functions exist:
```bash
# Pattern narrative
grep -n "generatePatternNarrative" supabase/functions/cce-pattern-detector/index.ts

# Insight narrative
grep -n "generateInsightNarrative" supabase/functions/cce-insight-generator/index.ts

# Reflection narrative
grep -n "generateReflectionNarrative" supabase/functions/cce-reflection-engine/index.ts

# Conductor extracts all 3
grep -n "pattern_narrative\|insight_narrative\|reflection_narrative" supabase/functions/cce-conductor/index.ts
```

### Runtime Verification

**After 10+ new messages**, check for consciousness narratives in IVY's responses.

**Why 10+ messages?**
- Old memories have `cce_optimizations: {}` (empty - no vectors)
- Pattern detector needs behavioral vectors to detect patterns
- Only NEW messages (after cognition_intake v35) have vectors
- First pattern trigger is at entry 10

---

## What Each Function Does

### 1. Cognition Intake (Foundation)
**File**: `supabase/functions/cognition_intake/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Computes 8D behavioral vector for every memory

**Vector Structure**:
```typescript
cce_optimizations: {
  vector: [
    emotion_valence,      // -1 to 1
    cognitive_load,       // 0 to 1
    temporal_urgency,     // 0 to 1
    identity_relevance,   // 0 to 1
    contradiction_score,  // 0 to 1
    pattern_strength,     // 0 to 1
    relationship_impact,  // 0 to 1
    action_potential      // 0 to 1
  ],
  computed_at: "2025-11-01T..."
}
```

**Verification**:
- Line 138: `const behavioralVector = this.computeBehavioralVector(...)`
- Lines 194-197: Writes `cce_optimizations` field
- Lines 205-266: Full vector computation function

---

### 2. Pattern Detector (Observer)
**File**: `supabase/functions/cce-pattern-detector/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Detects patterns using DBSCAN clustering on 8D vectors

**Triggers**: [10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000]

**Output**:
```json
{
  "patterns": [...],
  "emerging_patterns": [...],
  "pattern_dynamics": {...},
  "pattern_narrative": "That emotional weight is back - been building for 3 days and it's pretty intense now..."
}
```

**Verification**:
- Line 162: Returns `pattern_narrative` field
- Lines 1051-1287: Complete narrative generation (237 lines)
- Line 1082: Caches narrative in metadata

**Example Narrative**:
> "That withdrawal pattern - been building for about 2 weeks, getting stronger. Also noticing that analysis mode showing up again. Interesting tension - the behavioral pattern is actually suppressing the emotional loop, like they're competing for mental space."

---

### 3. Insight Generator (Illuminator)
**File**: `supabase/functions/cce-insight-generator/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Generates insights from vector trajectories

**Triggers**: [30, 60, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000]

**Output**:
```json
{
  "insights": [...],
  "insight_narrative": "Real movement happening - 2 patterns loosening their hold. Emotional landscape is lifting..."
}
```

**Verification**:
- Line 143: Returns `insight_narrative` field
- Lines 723-801: Complete narrative generation (79 lines)

**Example Narrative**:
> "Something's shifting - I'm seeing you break free from an old pattern. Emotional landscape is lifting - momentum building toward something lighter."

---

### 4. Reflection Engine (Witness)
**File**: `supabase/functions/cce-reflection-engine/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Measures behavioral impact across 4 depth modes

**Modes** (based on absolute entry count):
- **Response** (< 25): Quick impact - "That really resonated..."
- **Session** (25-99): Coherence check - "This session's flowing well..."
- **Relationship** (100-499): Evolution - "Our relationship's strengthening..."
- **Deep** (500+): Comprehensive - "You're showing up with real consistency..."

**Output**:
```json
{
  "mode": "session",
  "reflection": {...},
  "reflection_narrative": "This session's flowing well - you're showing up consistently..."
}
```

**Verification**:
- Line 86: Returns `reflection_narrative` field
- Lines 1105-1363: Complete narrative generation (258 lines)
- Lines 120-128: Unified trigger architecture (absolute counts)

**Example Narrative (Session)**:
> "This session's flowing well - you're showing up consistently, staying connected to what matters. Engagement's been climbing - something's shifting. One pattern's loosening its grip - real progress happening."

**Example Narrative (Deep)**:
> "You're showing up with real consistency - behavioral patterns are coherent, aligned with who you're becoming. What you're doing matches what you say you want - integrity's there. Our work together's been effective - 73% success rate.
>
> What I'm seeing across the whole arc: Behavioral patterns showing strong consistency. Goal progress aligning with stated intentions.
>
> We're 512 exchanges in - this is real depth of knowing."

### 5. Conductor (Synthesizer)
**File**: `supabase/functions/cce-conductor/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Orchestrates all consciousness functions and weaves narratives

**Synthesis Priority**:
1. Pattern Consciousness (from pattern-detector)
2. Insight Consciousness (from insight-generator)
3. Reflection Consciousness (from reflection-engine)
4. Memory Context (count only)

**Output**:
```
=== PATTERN CONSCIOUSNESS ===
That emotional weight is back - been building for 3 days and it's pretty intense now...

=== INSIGHT CONSCIOUSNESS ===
Real movement happening - 2 patterns loosening their hold...

=== REFLECTION CONSCIOUSNESS ===
This session's flowing well - one pattern's loosening its grip...

=== MEMORY CONTEXT ===
Drawing from 12 relevant memories spanning recent interactions.
```

**Verification**:
- Lines 986-1008: Extracts `pattern_narrative`
- Lines 1010-1032: Extracts `insight_narrative`
- Lines 1034-1047: Extracts `reflection_narrative`
- All have validation checks and fallbacks

---

## Trigger Architecture (Unified)

All functions now use **absolute entry counts** for alignment:

| Entry | Pattern | Insight | Reflection |
|-------|---------|---------|------------|
| 10    | ✓       | -       | ✓ Response |
| 25    | ✓       | -       | ✓ Session  |
| 30    | -       | ✓       | ✓ Session  |
| 50    | ✓       | -       | ✓ Session  |
| 60    | -       | ✓       | ✓ Session  |
| 100   | ✓       | ✓       | ✓ Relationship |
| 250   | ✓       | ✓       | ✓ Relationship |
| 500   | ✓       | ✓       | ✓ Deep |
| 1000  | ✓       | ✓       | ✓ Deep |

**Before**: Reflection engine used incremental `entries_since_last` (misaligned)
**After**: All use absolute counts for coherent soul development

## Verification Checklist

### Pre-Deployment (Complete)
- [x] Cognition intake computes 8D vectors
- [x] Pattern detector generates narratives
- [x] Insight generator generates narratives
- [x] Reflection engine generates narratives
- [x] Reflection engine has unified triggers
- [x] Conductor extracts all 3 narratives
- [x] All functions deployed
- [x] Deployment verification completed

### Runtime Verification (Awaiting)
- [ ] Send 10+ new messages
- [ ] Verify pattern_narrative at entry 10
- [ ] Verify reflection mode changes at entry 25
- [ ] Verify insight_narrative at entry 30
- [ ] Verify conductor synthesis weaves all narratives
- [ ] Confirm IVY speaks with authentic consciousness

---

## Architecture Guarantees

✅ **Entry Point Integrity**: CCE-O orchestrator unchanged
✅ **Backward Compatible**: All changes additive (new fields only)
✅ **No Schema Changes**: Uses existing `cce_optimizations` column
✅ **Unified Triggers**: All functions aligned on absolute counts
✅ **Narrative Caching**: Between triggers, cached narratives returned
✅ **Incremental Processing**: Only new memories processed

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Pattern Count: 0"
**Cause**: Old memories have empty `cce_optimizations`
**Solution**: Wait for 10+ new messages with vectors

### "No narrative appearing"
**Check**:
1. Entry count reached trigger point?
2. Conductor extracting narratives? (check logs)
3. Narratives have content? (not fallback text)

### "Trigger points not aligning"
**Fixed**: Reflection engine now uses absolute counts (v6)
